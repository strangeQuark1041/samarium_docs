## About

<script src="https://asciinema.org/a/14.js" id="asciicast-14" async></script>

Samarium started as a pet project of mine. I wanted to experience physics and scientific ideas interactively. It also became an opportunity for me to learn modern programming tools, namely git, C++ and conan

## Components

Samarium is broken up into these components:

1. `math`: [`math` itself](math.md), [Vector2](Vector2.md): core math functions for computation
2. `graphics`: `Color`, `Image`, and `Renderer`: drawing stuff in 2d
