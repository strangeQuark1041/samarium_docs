## About

<!-- <script src="https://asciinema.org/a/14.js" id="asciicast-14" async></script> -->

Samarium started as a pet project of mine. I wanted to experience physics and scientific ideas interactively. It also became an opportunity for me to learn modern programming tools, namely git, C++ and conan

## Components

Samarium is broken up into these components:

1. `math`: [`math` itself]({{< ref "math.md" >}}), [Vector2]({{< ref "Vector2.md" >}}): core math functions for computation
2. `graphics`: `Color`, `Image`, and `Renderer`: drawing stuff in 2d
3. `gui`: `Window`: Windowing and user interaction
4. `physics`
5. `util`
